## Introduction
Structs with many fields can be difficult to manage, making it easy to overlook unused or unValidated fields. Itâ€™s important to ensure that all struct fields are either used for state changes, read operations, or properly validated within the function or contract logic.

## Why I missed the vulnerability
I didnâ€™t verify that all fields in the struct were used within the function.

## What to look out for
- Ensure all fields in the struct are meaningfully used or validated in the function.
