# Smart Contract Vulnerabilities Knowledge Base

A personal knowledge base for smart contract auditing. I use this to:

- Document vulnerabilities I've encountered or missed
- Reflect on why/how I missed them
- Record mitigation techniques
- Build and refine audit checklists to avoid missing similar issues again

This repo is structured to improve my auditing precision and evolve my audit workflows over time.
